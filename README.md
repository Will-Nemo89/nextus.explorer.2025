Nextus Explorer App

Fractal Life Path Visualization

This project is a Streamlit-based interactive app that visualizes a fractal-inspired life path based on key life events. The app plots life decisions as "nexus points" and connects them recursively to simulate fractal growth.

Features

📊 Fractal-Inspired Graph: Visualizes major life events with fractal-like connections.

🖥️ Interactive Streamlit App: Users can input their own life events.

📌 Simple Deployment: Easily run on Streamlit Cloud, Render, or Hugging Face Spaces.
